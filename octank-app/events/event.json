Air quality, resource availability—everything about the way we live is impacted by the health of our ecosystem.

This is great news as carbon dioxide gets trapped in our atmosphere for decades, and methane emissions—the negative impacts of which are twenty-five times greater than that of carbon dioxide—make things even more dangerous.A home that gets its energy from solar is a big win for public health. After all, as the threat of climate change continues to impact our way of life we all need to do what we can and make sustainable adjustments to how we work, live, and play for the good of the planet. If you live in a solar ready home with strong energy potential, making the switch can do more than save you money, it can help you save the place we all call home.When considering your home energy options, solar is truly unmatched.
